Level design 
* To do way later : Optional routes that player can miss. Must replay to discover them.  -> Finds bonus.
* MAYBE NOT? : Camera : allow for flexible changes in camera. Stopping, restarting, vertical movement, as needed (triggers on .tmx)
//* Destructible blocks
* Dinamically placed GOAL (different templates for the end of each level type)
* Dinamically placed LEVEL START
* Once tiles 0 - 9 have their role and if the game feels limited, rework the mapChunk generator so taht it can take 
  any alphanumeric character and assign game elementsaccordingly.

-- Items --

* Items need to look attractice and make the player wanna "get them". So as they appear, they should maybe move in a sine wave, glow or something.
//* + Max HP item
//* + MoveSpeed item
* Homing bullets item
* Spread bullet item
* Grenade bullet item

-- Design ideas  -- 
* Maybe ??Maybe use the points as currency to buy randomly chosen items on level transitions? Or just leave them as score, but it make meaningful somehow.
* Survivor mode

* Possible enemy attribute. Enemies that have a "bomb" attached to them. If they get past the player (out of the screen), this triggers a bomb that draw a horizontal
  line across the screen, from the point it exploded.
  
* Items don't have their use revealed until they're picked up. Just like scrolls in classic roguelikes. Then, once picked the item remains the same for the rest of the 
  run.
  
* Item or condition that will make the scroller go faster / slower.

* Enemies that come from the left
