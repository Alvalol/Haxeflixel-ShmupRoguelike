/**
* Revolute joint definition. This requires defining an
* anchor point where the bodies are joined. The definition
* uses local anchor points so that the initial configuration
* can violate the constraint slightly. You also need to
* specify the initial relative angle for joint limits. This
* helps when saving and loading a game.
* The local anchor points are measured from the body's origin
* rather than the center of mass because:
* 1. you might not know where the center of mass will be.
* 2. if you add/remove shapes from a body and recompute the mass,
* the joints will be broken.
