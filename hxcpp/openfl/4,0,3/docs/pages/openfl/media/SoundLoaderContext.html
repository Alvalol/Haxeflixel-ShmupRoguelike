sound. SoundLoaderContext objects are passed as an argument to the
constructor and the <code>load()</code> method of the Sound class.</p><p>When you use this class, consider the following security model: </p><ul>
  <li>Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in
a network sandbox and the sound file to be loaded is local.</li>
  <li>By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling
is local and tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant
explicit permission to allow this.</li>
  <li>Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a
loaded sound cannot be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you
implement a URL policy file. Sound-related APIs that fall under this
restriction are the <code>Sound.id3</code> property and the
<code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>,
<code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code>, and <code>SoundTransform()</code>
methods.</li>
</ul><p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
these security limitations.</p><p>For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer

from the loaded sound's server before beginning to load the sound. This
property applies to sound that is loaded from outside the calling file's
own domain using the <code>Sound.load()</code> method.</p><p>Set this property to <code>true</code> when you load a sound from
outside the calling file's own domain and code in the calling file needs
low-level access to the sound's data. Examples of low-level access to a
sound's data include referencing the <code>Sound.id3</code> property to
get an ID3Info object or calling the
<code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code> method to get sound samples from
the loaded sound. If you try to access sound data without setting the
<code>checkPolicyFile</code> property to <code>true</code> at loading
time, you may get a SecurityError exception because the required policy
file has not been downloaded.</p><p>If you don't need low-level access to the sound data that you are
loading, avoid setting <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code>.
Checking for a policy file consumes network bandwidth and might delay the
start of your download, so it should only be done when necessary.</p><p>When you call <code>Sound.load()</code> with
<code>SoundLoaderContext.checkPolicyFile</code> set to <code>true</code>,
Flash Player or AIR must either successfully download a relevant URL
policy file or determine that no such policy file exists before it begins
downloading the specified sound. Flash Player or AIR performs the
following actions, in this order, to verify the existence of a policy
file:</p><ul>
  <li>Flash Player or AIR considers policy files that have already been
downloaded.</li>
  <li>Flash Player or AIR tries to download any pending policy files
specified in calls to <code>Security.loadPolicyFile()</code>.</li>
  <li>Flash Player or AIR tries to download a policy file from the default
location that corresponds to the sound's URL, which is
<code>/crossdomain.xml</code> on the same server as
<code>URLRequest.url</code>.(The sound's URL is specified in the
<code>url</code> property of the URLRequest object passed to
<code>Sound.load()</code> or the Sound() constructor function.)</li>
</ul><p>In all cases, Flash Player or AIR requires that an appropriate policy
file exist on the sound's server, that it provide access to the sound file
at <code>URLRequest.url</code> by virtue of the policy file's location,
and that it allow the domain of the calling file to access the sound,
through one or more <code><allow-access-from></code> tags. </p><p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code>, Flash
Player or AIR waits until the policy file is verified before loading the
sound. You should wait to perform any low-level operations on the sound
data, such as calling <code>Sound.id3</code> or
<code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>, until <code>progress</code> and
<code>complete</code> events are dispatched from the Sound object. </p><p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code> but no
appropriate policy file is found, you will not receive an error until you
perform an operation that requires a policy file, and then Flash Player or
AIR throws a <code>SecurityError</code> exception. After you receive a
<code>complete</code> event, you can test whether a relevant policy file
was found by getting the value of <code>Sound.id3</code> within a
<code>try</code> block and seeing if a <code>SecurityError</code> is
thrown.</p><p>Be careful with <code>checkPolicyFile</code> if you are downloading
sound from a URL that uses server-side HTTP redirects. Flash Player or AIR
tries to retrieve policy files that correspond to the <code>url</code>
property of the URLRequest object passed to <code>Sound.load()</code>. If
the final sound file comes from a different URL because of HTTP redirects,
then the initially downloaded policy files might not be applicable to the
sound's final URL, which is the URL that matters in security
decisions.</p><p>If you find yourself in this situation, here is one possible solution.
After you receive a <code>progress</code> or <code>complete</code> event,
you can examine the value of the <code>Sound.url</code> property, which
contains the sound's final URL. Then call the
<code>Security.loadPolicyFile()</code> method with a policy file URL that
you calculate based on the sound's final URL. Finally, poll the value of
<code>Sound.id3</code> until no exception is thrown.</p><p>This does not apply to content in the AIR application sandbox. Content
in the application sandbox always has programatic access to sound content,
regardless of its origin.</p><p>For more information related to security, see the Flash Player
