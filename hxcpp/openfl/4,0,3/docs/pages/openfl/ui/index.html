environment's support for handling contact from user input devices,
including contact that has two or more touch points(such as a user's
fingers on a touch screen). When a user interacts with a device such as a
mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen, the user typically touches the
screen with his or her fingers or a pointing device. While there is a broad
range of pointing devices, such as a mouse or a stylus, many of these
devices only have a single point of contact with an application. For
pointing devices with a single point of contact, user interaction events
can be handled as a mouse event, or using a basic set of touch events
(called "touch point" events). However, for pointing devices that have
several points of contact and perform complex movement, such as the human
hand, Flash runtimes support an additional set of event handling API called
gesture events. The API for handling user interaction with these gesture
events includes the following classes:</p></td>                    </tr>                                                        <tr>                        <td width="200"><a href="../../openfl/ui/MultitouchInputMode.html">MultitouchInputMode</a></td>                        <td><p>The MultitouchInputMode class provides values for the
<code>inputMode</code> property in the flash.ui.Multitouch class. These
values set the type of touch events the Flash runtime dispatches when the
user interacts with a touch-enabled device.</p></td>                    </tr>                            </tbody>        </table>    </div>        </div></div>    <script src="https://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/loader/run_prettify.js"></script></body></html>
