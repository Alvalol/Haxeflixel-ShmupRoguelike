other information to be used in a dynamic, data-driven application.</p><p>A URLLoader object downloads all of the data from a URL before making it
available to code in the applications. It sends out notifications about the
progress of the download, which you can monitor through the
<code>bytesLoaded</code> and <code>bytesTotal</code> properties, as well as
through dispatched events.</p><p>When loading very large video files, such as FLV's, out-of-memory errors
may occur. </p><p>When you use this class in Flash Player and in AIR application content
in security sandboxes other than then application security sandbox,
consider the following security model:</p><ul>
  <li>A SWF file in the local-with-filesystem sandbox may not load data
from, or provide data to, a resource that is in the network sandbox. </li>
  <li> By default, the calling SWF file and the URL you load must be in
exactly the same domain. For example, a SWF file at www.adobe.com can load
data only from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a
different domain, place a URL policy file on the server hosting the
data.</li>

<p>@event complete           Dispatched after all the received data is decoded
                          and placed in the data property of the URLLoader
                          object. The received data may be accessed once
                          this event has been dispatched.
@event httpResponseStatus Dispatched if a call to the load() method
                          attempts to access data over HTTP, and Adobe AIR
                          is able to detect and return the status code for
                          the request.
@event httpStatus         Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts
                          to access data over HTTP. For content running in
                          Flash Player, this event is only dispatched if
                          the current Flash Player environment is able to
                          detect and return the status code for the
                          request.(Some browser environments may not be
                          able to provide this information.) Note that the
                          <code>httpStatus</code> event(if any) is sent
                          before(and in addition to) any
                          <code>complete</code> or <code>error</code>
                          event.
@event ioError            Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() results
                          in a fatal error that terminates the download.
@event open               Dispatched when the download operation commences
                          following a call to the
                          <code>URLLoader.load()</code> method.
@event progress           Dispatched when data is received as the download
                          operation progresses.</p>
<p>                          <p>Note that with a URLLoader object, it is not
                          possible to access the data until it has been
                          received completely. So, the progress event only
                          serves as a notification of how far the download
                          has progressed. To access the data before it's
                          entirely downloaded, use a URLStream object. </p>
@event securityError      Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts
                          to load data from a server outside the security
                          sandbox. Also dispatched if a call to
