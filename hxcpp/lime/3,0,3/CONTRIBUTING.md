How To Contribute
=================

We welcome your feedback and input in how to make Lime better!

If you are interested in discussing new features, the direction the project or how to integrate some change, please open an issue so we can talk about.

 1. Fork the repository
 
 2. Make the desired change
 
 3. Create a pull request


You may consider creating a branch specific to the fix or improvement you wish to make, in case you have more than one that has not been accepted into the project, or to allow for item-specific changes.

It is our goal to help Lime evolve as a clean, easy-to-use (but powerful) layer for cross-platform development. Thanks for being a part of making this possible!
