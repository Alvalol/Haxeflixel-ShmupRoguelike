This is the repository for a Roguelike Shmup made with Haxeflixel :) 

The game and its development is inspired by Gradius, R-TYPE and Spelunky.

It's currently in active (and early) development. 

I stream regularly on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/Alvaro_As) and [LiveCoding](https://www.livecoding.tv/alvalol/)
Enjoy!

I will make a proper README.md eventually, I swear.
